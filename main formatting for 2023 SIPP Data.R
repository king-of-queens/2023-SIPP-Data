##Data READIN VALIDATION

# SIPP data are in person-month format, meaning each record represents one month for a specific person.
#   Unique persons are identified using SSUID+PNUM. 
#   Unique households are identified using SSUID+ERESIDENCEID.
#   For additional guidance on using SIPP data, please see the SIPP Users' Guide at <https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/guidance/users-guide.html>

##DATA FORMATTING
#deduplicating and grouping data points to find unique persons
Person_SIPP_2023 <- SIPP_Combined_2023 %>%
  mutate(PNUM = as.character(PNUM)) %>% 
  mutate(unique_ID = paste(SSUID, PNUM)) %>%
